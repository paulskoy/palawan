            Salvador is the capital of the state of Bahia, a place renowned for its natural beauty, friendliness of its people, and the strong influence of African culture.
        </p>

        <p class="first-section-text">
            The moves associated with Capoeira, a cultural expression that combines fighting and dancing, the smells and flavors of the local cuisine, the melting pot of different religions, cultural diversity, and natural beauty, all of it combined defines the local population: friendly people that really know the true meaning of enjoying life. The city also hosts one of the country’s most famous carnival celebrations.

            The Historic Center of Salvador is a place where visitors will find streets and architectural monuments that date back to Colonial Brazil, the Empire, and the First Republic. Containing the neighborhoods of Sé, Pilar, and Pelourinho (added to Unesco’s World Cultural Heritage List), the region is culturally rich and the home to historic monuments from the period between the 17th and 19th centuries, making it a very popular destination with tourists looking for museums, theaters, churches, musical performances, local cuisine, and handicrafts.

            The Historic Center of Salvador is a place where visitors will find streets and architectural monuments that date back to Colonial Brazil, the Empire, and the First Republic.

There are more than 300 churches in Salvador. One of them is São Francisco Church and Convent. Classified as one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World and on the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage List, the place displays 18th-century tiles that tell the story of Saint Francis of Assisi’s birth. The tiles are decorated with sculpted wooden pieces coated with gold powder. Another important attraction is the Basilica of Senhor do Bonfim, patron of Bahia and the symbol of the state’s religious diversity. 

In Salvador, Catholicism coexists in harmony with African religions, bringing together Iemanja and Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, Iansã and Saint Barbara, Our Lord of  Bonfim and Oxala.  African culture is also present in music, dance, and local cuisine, which is rich and diverse. While in town, make sure you try the typical local dishes: acarajé, (a type of fritter made with black-eyed peas), caruru (made with okra, onions, shrimp, palm oil, and toasted nuts), and vatapá (a creamy dish made with shrimp, coconut milk, finely ground peanuts, and palm oil). They can be bought straight from the baianas (Afro-Brazilian women who, since colonial times, have sold food on the streets of Salvador). 

Salvador is the best gateway for those who intend to visit the Coconut Coast (Costa dos Coqueiros), the Palm Oil Coast (Costa do Dendê), and Chapada Diamantina National Park. You will find wonderful places in Bahia where nature is beautifully preserved. The state also has a variety of charming resorts and lodges that boast perfect infrastructure to host tourists.
