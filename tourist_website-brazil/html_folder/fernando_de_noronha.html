            Fernando de Noronha is the perfect combination of crystal-clear waters, golden sand, and rich marine life that amazes people from all around the world.
        <p class="first-section-text">
            Comprising 21 islands and islets, the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha is a place of indescribable beauty and importance, earning a place on the UNESCO World Natural Heritage List. Local beaches are divided into two categories: the inner sea beaches (those facing the South American continent), and the outer sea beaches (those facing the open Atlantic Ocean and the African continent). 

            It is very common to see the names of Fernando de Noronha’s beaches listed among the most beautiful in Brazil and in the world. Some of the most popular are the Bay of Pigs (Baía dos Porcos), Lion Beach (Praia do Leão), and Sancho Bay (Baía do Sancho), which was twice voted the best beach on the planet by TripAdvisor’s Travelers’ Choice Awards.

        <p class="second-section-text">
            Noronha, as it is commonly called, is also one of the best locations for diving. Its mild clear waters provide excellent visibility, making it possible to observe the splendid local marine life, including coral reefs, dolphins, turtles, and sharks. Visitors are able to go scuba diving if guided by certified local instructors. 

            Another very common sport on the island is surfing. Between the months of December and February, Fernando de Noronha is visited by surfers from all over the world looking for the island’s perfect tubes, huge swells, and waves of up to 5 meters in height. The best beaches for surfing are: Cacimba do Padre, Boldró, and Conceição. 

            There are a variety of activities on the island for people of all ages. These activities include ecological trails, boat rides to observe dolphins, and visits to the National Marine Park and the Shark Museum, not to mention the Tamar project, which aims to protect endangered sea turtles. 

            Another activity that every visitor in Fernando de Noronha must do is enjoy the famous local sunset. There are several locations on the island where you can enjoy it, such as at the Boldro Fort Viewpoint (Forte do Boldró), Dois Irmãos Viewpoint (Mirante Dois Irmãos), and Conceição and Porto beaches. 

            Tourists planning to visit Noronha must carry cash as not all establishments on the island accept credit and debit cards, and there are not many places to withdraw money. In addition, in order for the archipelago to keep protecting local nature, the number of visitors is limited, and an environmental protection fee must be paid to enter the island.
