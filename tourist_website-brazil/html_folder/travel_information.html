                    <li>Brazil has increasingly invested in public safety. The country has been strengthening security in tourist destinations so tourists who intend to visit the country can feel safe when traveling to Brazil.</li>
                    <li>The Ministry of Tourism is creating the Safe Tourism Program, a national program that focuses on several fields of action to increase tourist safety. This way, visitors will be able to enjoy all the wonderful attractions Brazil has to offer.</li>
                    <li>If there are any incidents, there are police stations all over the Brazilian territory. Most capital cities have specialized police stations to assist tourists. If you happen to be in a city where there is no specialized police station for tourists, you can contact any regular police station to file your incident report. This means more safety and attention for tourists who come to Brazil.</li>

                    <li>Citizens of Mercosur member states do not need a visa to enter and stay in Brazil, the need only a valid passport or national identity document. Citizens of Australia, Canada, the United States of America, Japan, and the European Union are also exempt from visas to enter the Brazilian territory, and only need a valid passport. Visitor visas may be granted for different purposes, such as tourism, business, transit, and artistic or sports activities. Visitors on this type of visa are allowed to stay for a maximum of ninety days.</li>
                    <li>Brazil’s visa policy is based on the principle of reciprocity. This basically means that most countries that require visas from Brazilian citizens to enter their territories will also need a visa to travel to Brazil. Under current Brazilian immigration law (Law 13,445 of 2017), visa exemption may only be granted by the Brazilian authorities on a reciprocal basis, and through mutual understanding on the matter, except for the circumstances described in Decree 9,731 of 2019. Brazil currently has bilateral agreements on visa waivers with approximately 90 countries.</li>
                    <li>Foreigners who wish to apply for a visa to travel to Brazil should contact Brazilian Consular Representations abroad in order to obtain more information on the application process.</li>
