            Aracaju, the capital city in the state of Sergipe, has beautiful beaches where visitors will be able to rest or have fun surrounded by beautiful sand dunes and coconut trees.
        <p class="first-section-text">
            Founded in 1855, the city was Brazil’s first planned state capital. Known for its beautiful beaches and catamaran rides, Aracaju’s urban planning was done in such a way that its streets were designed to end at the Sergipe River, which flows through the city and into the sea. 

            Atalaia Waterfront, the main tourist site in the city, is six-kilometers long and contains a large leisure complex, hotels, and restaurants. There is also an Oceanarium there, which is home to several Brazilian marine wildlife species. The Oceanarium is administered by the Tamar Project, a global reference in the protection of sea turtles in Brazil.

        <p class="second-section-text">
            While on the river banks, take the time to learn about the history of the capital. You can start with the Emperor’s Bridge (Ponte do Imperador), the path Emperor Dom Pedro II would take to come to the city when visiting the province. In the Historic Center, you will be able to see churches, monuments, museums, as well as shopping malls, crafts markets, and regional food centers.

            To experience the beauty of local culture and the flavors of local cuisine, you should definitely visit Aracaju’s Popular Market (Mercado Popular de Aracaju), which is, in fact, made up of three different markets brought together in one place. Try some tropical fruit and seafood dishes, such as crabs, a symbol of the city’s gastronomy. You will also be able to appreciate the city’s cultural diversity through local handicrafts, literature, utensils, clothing, and embroidery. Whatever you do, do not leave without trying the local crab stew, some mangaba (a typical local fruit) juice, and aratu (a small crab from local mangroves) cooked in banana leaves.   

            The Gente Sergipana Museum is also worth a visit. It is the first interactive multimedia museum in the north and northeast of Brazil, and its goal is to exhibit Sergipe’s tangible and intangible cultural heritage. 

            In Brazil, the month of June is marked by celebrations honoring the main catholic saints in the country, such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Peter the Apostle, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Paul the Apostle. For those who want to know what a typical June festival is, you can go to Forró Caju, one of the largest June festivities in the northeast of Brazil, which takes place at the end of the month. The event includes its own set on location, delicious typical food, and lively square dancing, a traditional dance at June festivals. Visitors will also be able to dance a lot of forró, a popular dance from the Northeast region, and try several dishes made from corn, such as pamonha (a paste made of sweet corn wrapped in corn husk) and canjica (hominy porridge). 

            When you visit Aracaju, you must make some time to go to São Cristóvão, a historic city in Sergipe located less than 30km from the capital. São Francisco Square, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, is definitely worth a visit. Another attraction that everyone must experience is Xingó Canyon, with its high rock walls that offer an unforgettable natural spectacle. The tour of the São Francisco River and the beautiful navigable canyon can be done on catamarans or schooners.
