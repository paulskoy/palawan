            Known as “Brazilian Mesopotamia” due to its position on the banks of Poti and Parnaíba Rivers, Teresina is a delightful destination. The capital of Piauí charms its visitors with its rich history and culture, as well as with beautiful local handicraft.
        </p>

        <p class="first-section-text">
            Teresina is renowned for its beautiful freshwater beaches, tree-lined streets, urban parks, and rich history. This charming and vibrant city has attractions for any type of tourist. 
            Located on the banks of Poti and Parnaíba rivers, the city is home to the Meeting of Rivers Environmental Park (Encontro dos Rios), one of the most popular tourist attractions in the state. It’s the exact location where the rivers meet and become one on its way to the Atlantic Ocean. Visitors will be able to buy unique handicraft pieces from local artists that make functional, religious, and studio pottery with clay taken from the riverbeds of both rivers.
        </p>

        <p class="second-section-text">
            The Park is just one of the city’s many green areas that preserve local vegetation in the middle of the urban area. It is invigorating to visit the ecological parks in Teresina and really connect with nature.

            If you are into religious tourism, Teresina will not let you down. There are local tours to visit churches that date back to the days when the city was founded, such as the Church of Our Lady of Protection,  the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows, the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, and the Saint Benedict Parish, whose doors have been added to the National Heritage List by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN). 

            For the arts fans, Piauí Museum is a great option. The museum has an eclectic collection that contains approximately 7,000 pieces, including art pieces and porcelain that belonged to the Dutch West India Company. But if you really want to enjoy local art, you should definitely visit Poty Velho Ceramic Center. Inaugurated in 2006, the complex contains around 50 stores that produce one of Teresina’s greatest treasures: pottery handicraft. The activity, developed by riverside communities since the 1970s, is part of the city’s intangible cultural heritage and has helped to develop local craftsmanship. Local handicraft is currently commercialized nationally and internationally.

            Cable-Stayed Bridge Tourist Complex (Ponte Estaiada) is one of the icons of Teresina. The Bridge over Poti River was built to celebrate the city’s 150th anniversary. It is a modern structure that includes a 95-meter-tall observation deck from which visitors have a privileged view of the entire city. 

            Anyone visiting Teresina will fall in love with the local flavors. Capote (guinea fowl with adjuma peppers) and Maria Isabel (rice with dried beef) are two of the delicious local dishes. Cajuína, a non-alcoholic drink made of cashew apples, and fruit compotes made with local fruit such as mangoes, cashew apples, lemons, and buriti, are also popular in the city. 

            Teresina perfectly combines modern qualities with the simplicity of the backcountry. Those who visit the city will certainly experience a little of the beautiful backlands culture.
