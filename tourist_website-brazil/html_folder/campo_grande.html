            The charming capital of Mato Grosso do Sul is surrounded by beautiful nature. Tourists are also fascinated by the city’s unique culture and local cuisine.
        </p>

        <p class="first-section-text">
            Founded by cattle raisers and farmers from the state of Minas Gerais searching for good pastures and ample water supply, Campo Grande soon discovered and developed its economic calling. However, the immigrants from Minas Gerais were not the only people who influenced the local culture. The city is a peculiar melting pot that also combines the second largest indigenous community in the country and Japanese immigrants that came over in the early 20th century.

        <p class="second-section-text">
            The effects of this wonderful combination can be seen, for example, in the local cuisine. Places like the Central Market are perfect to try local favorites such as tereré (an infusion of yerba mate served cold in a guampa cup), Paraguayan Soup (a savory cake made from cornmeal, onions, and cheese), sobá (Okinawa-style noodles, with sliced egg omelette, and chives), and locro (a thick soup made with squash, beans, and corn). Visitors should also make the time to visit Antônio Valente Municipal Market, a place where they will be able to experience several different flavors and enjoy the beautiful local handicrafts.

            For those who want to enjoy the countryside but do not want to wander too far from the city, there are farms and rural resorts with excellent infrastructure around Campo Grande where visitors can spend their day. It’s a great opportunity to go horseback riding, enjoy a typical farm-style breakfast, go swimming in local rivers, interact with farm animals, and take some time to rest in hammocks.
            
            Indigenous culture plays an important role in Campo Grande. Local handicraft work, for example, features beautiful pottery, bows and arrows, hand fans, custom lace designs and embroidery, berrantes (blowing horns made of hollowed out cattle horns and used to blow loud warning sounds by local cowboys to lead their cattle), and typical dolls. You will find all of that and more at the Artisan’s House (Casa do Artesão), an arts and crafts store that has earned its place on the state’s historic and cultural heritage list.
            
            Right in the middle of the city, visitors have the chance to visit a genuine indigenous village, the Indigenous Culture Memorial (Memorial da Cultura Indígena). Besides being a cultural center where indigenous products are commercialized, it is the home of more than 100 indigenous families. The Indigenous Nations Park (Parque das Nações Indígenas) also strengthens the community by hosting the Monument to Indigenous Communities, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Dom Bosco Museum of Cultures. Not too far from the park, visitors can visit the Saint Francis Matrice Church, whose stained-glass windows tell the story of Saint Francis of Assisi.
            
            The swarthy city (cidade morena), as it is locally called because of the reddish-brown colour of its soil, is truly a charming city. You can’t help but fall in love with it.
